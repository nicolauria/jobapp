Runtime for an algorithm can be described in three ways:
- Best Case
- Worst Case
- Expected Case

When speakin in terms of Big O we always use the worst case.

1 - constant time
log n - logarithmic time
n - linear time
n log n - linearithmic time
n^2 - quadratic time
2^n - exponential time
n! - factorial time

when considering addition we always drop the smaller Big O variables
- so n^2 + n = n^2

when considering multiplication we drop the constants
- so 2n = n

subtraction and division can be converted to addition/multiplication
