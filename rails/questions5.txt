How should you test routes?

How should you use filters in controllers?

What are Strong Parameters?

Strong Parameters is a feature of Rails that prevents assigning request parameters to objects unless they have been explicitly permitted

def user_params
  params.require(:user).permit(:first_name, :last_name, :email)
end

What do we need to test in controllers?

How should you use content_for and yield?

https://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#using-the-content-for-method

How should you use nested layouts?

https://railsguides.net/rails-nested-layouts/

By default, application.html.erb is your layout. You can render a default sub-layout by calling it as a partial from your application layout:

# app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
<div id="one" >
    <%= render "layouts/asdf" %>
</div>

# app/views/layouts/_asdf.html.erb
<div id="two">
    <%= yield %>
</div>

This will output the following:

<div id="one>
   <div id="two">
      <%= yield %>
   </div>
</div>
