What is Rack?

Rack is a layer between the framework (Rails) & the application server (Puma). We use Rack because that allows different frameworks & servers to be interchangeable. They become components that you can plug-in.

Rack sits in the middle of every web request & response.

Rack is essentially small Ruby programs that get called as part of the request-response cycle & get a chance to do something with it.

What kind of things is this used for?

Logging
Sessions
Profiling (find out how long a request takes to complete)
Caching
Security (deny requests based on IP address, or limit # of request)
Serving static files (css, js, pngâ€¦)
